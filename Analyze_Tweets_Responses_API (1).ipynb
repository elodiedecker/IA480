    "It covers essential techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connecting to a MongoDB database** to store and retrieve tweets.\n",
    "- **Extracting tweets** and converting them into a structured format for further analysis.\n",
    "- **Creating a vector store** and uploading tweets for semantic search.\n",
    "- **Using file search** to analyze private datasets.\n",
    "- **Performing web search** to retrieve the latest public information.\n",
    "- **Utilizing stateful responses** to maintain conversation context.\n",
    "- **Combining file and web search** to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, users will be able to integrate OpenAI's Responses API for efficient data retrieval \n",

       "Karim Souaid, the newly appointed governor of Lebanon's central bank, has prioritized combating money laundering and terrorist financing. This focus addresses concerns from international bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the United States. Lebanon was placed on the FATF’s grey list in 2024, impacting investor confidence amid efforts to recover from a severe financial crisis. Souaid's agenda includes identifying influential individuals, maintaining the bank's independence, rescheduling public debt, repaying depositors, and encouraging private banks to increase capital or consider mergers. Non-compliant banks may face liquidation, with protections for depositors.

These entities reportedly used front companies and shell corporations, including currency exchange businesses at the U.S.-Mexico border, to facilitate money laundering. The sanctions aim to disrupt the cartel's financial operations, particularly its trafficking of fentanyl into the United States.

He aimed to help women associated with ISIS escape prison camps. Chhipa, married to Allison Fluke-Ekren (serving a 20-year sentence for her involvement with ISIS), will be sentenced in May.
